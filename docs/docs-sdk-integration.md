# Docs SDK integration and compatibility

ForaOffice separates the Docs editor from its desktop host and built-in agent.
The [SDK guide](../apps/docs/sdk/README.md) is the authoritative public API and
integration reference. This page describes responsibility and compatibility;
it does not declare the development SDK fully accepted.

## Components and responsibility

| Component              | Owns                                                                                                                       | Does not supply automatically                                         |
| ---------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Docs editor            | Document editing, selection, review, live context, runtime tools, inspection and view annotations                          | Application storage, native windows, model inference or conversations |
| Host adapter           | File or managed-document storage, permissions, dialogs, clipboard, assets, fonts, printing/export and application settings | Permission to arbitrary files or a model configuration                |
| External Harness/agent | Conversation, model/provider selection, task orchestration and optional instruction resolution                             | Authority to a replacement document or a different selection          |
| Portable Node services | Authorized file processing, bounded Office CLI/resource helpers, shared exports and MCP adapters                           | An installed Electron/Qt runtime or a remote service deployment       |

The inherited Electron desktop agent is one consumer of the editor. Embedded
hosts do not need Genspark authentication, a provider key, the native AI sidebar
or a GenOffice conversation implementation. A host can mount the editor without
an agent and later connect its runtime directly or through standard MCP.

## Integration targets

| Target           | Requirements and current boundary                                                                                                                                                                       |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Browser renderer | A browser supporting the ES2022 renderer bundle and its web dependencies; the host implements the services used by its application. Browsers do not acquire native file or print services from the SDK. |
| Electron host    | Injected host services and the same public mount API. The existing standalone desktop app is a separate consumer with its own preload and main-process requirements.                                    |
| Qt host          | Qt 6.8+ with Widgets, WebEngineWidgets, WebChannel, Network and PrintSupport; matching native toolchain and deployed Qt runtime. The reusable widget and sample host are included as sources.           |
| Node services    | Node 24+; documented peer dependencies for typed MCP transport integration and Node types for TypeScript consumers.                                                                                     |
| Other editors    | Sheets, Slides, PDF, Markdown and HTML remain inherited desktop implementations. No equivalent portable SDK or completion claim is made for them.                                                       |

These are integration requirements, not evidence that every OS/engine combination
has been tested. Use the source revision and exact host, engine and client versions
recorded with a delivery's GitHub acceptance evidence. An unavailable or skipped
target is not a verified target. The Qt sample currently opens `.docx`; legacy
Word, ODF, Hancom and HTML/MHT chunk conversion require explicit host integration.
The Electron application retains its own converters.

## Public editor lifecycle

Mount through `mountDocsEditor` with a host adapter, await the mount and
`editor.ready`, then use the public document, runtime and UI interfaces. Dispose
the editor when removing the view. One host/editor is supported per renderer
window; separate windows provide separate instances.

The SDK guide documents required file/native services and optional hosted
documents, resources, checkers, inspection, annotations, ribbon and file-menu
contributions. Optional capabilities must be provided explicitly. For managed
documents, the host owns opaque identity and complete DOCX bytes; unsupported
operations do not silently fall back to local storage.

Successful open/new completion publishes coherent document metadata and runtime
state. Captured scopes bind to a document generation and, when relevant, its
selection. They track valid edits without following a newly opened document.
Document replacement, authority withdrawal and disposal invalidate outstanding
authority. Callers must observe cancellation and freshness results rather than
blindly retrying against a different document.

## Choose an automation surface

| Surface                      | Data it operates on                                                                            | Integration contract                                                                                                 |
| ---------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Office CLI and its MCP tools | File-level operations against the specified input; they do not see an editor's unsaved content | [CLI reference](../packages/cli/README.md); existing `genoffice` command names remain compatibility names            |
| Inherited desktop automation | The desktop application's configured file or visible-editor services                           | Desktop settings/help for that consumer; not an embedded SDK prerequisite                                            |
| Embedded Docs runtime        | The mounted live document, including unsaved edits and captured authorized selection           | Public runtime callers and scopes in the [SDK guide](../apps/docs/sdk/README.md#invoke-the-live-document)            |
| Embedded Docs MCP            | The authorized live runtime via standard stdio or host-controlled Streamable HTTP              | [SDK MCP reference](../apps/docs/sdk/README.md#standard-mcp), including supported protocol revisions and host grants |

The private host command bridge is local IPC, not a public agent protocol or the
HTTP MCP URL. Embedded HTTP MCP binds loopback on an allocated port and uses a
host-issued credential. Do not reuse the desktop CLI server's URL, upload API or
session rules. The SDK guide records the supported transport revisions; a new
revision or client is accepted only after actual interoperability verification.

Hosts may forward editor-originated actions through `harness.submit` and may
resolve built-in instructions with stable operation identifiers. User-entered
instructions remain user input, not localized operation identifiers. Models,
templates, conversations and inference remain the embedding application's work.

## Permissions, persistence and privacy

File roots, exact dialog approvals and private-state exclusions are enforced by
the provided Node services. Hosts using their own services must enforce their
own authorization boundary. Resource selection does not grant arbitrary file
access; the bounded Office CLI is not a shell executor.

Save results distinguish committed, pending and unknown outcomes. Cancellation
does not roll back committed work. Preserve an outstanding draft's explicit
finalize/retain/discard decision before saving and obtain fresh context after a
stale-target result. See [Security](../SECURITY.md) and [Privacy](../PRIVACY.md)
for the trust boundaries and host/agent data responsibilities.

Versioning, package contents and delivery acceptance are described in
[SDK releases](docs-sdk-releases.md). The SDK is available through local build
and installation; a source checkout or package's existence is not a release or
an accepted complete-Docs milestone.
